# Harmonic Series Visualizer

Website to visualize the harmonic series given audio input from the user

I was recently learning about the Harmonic Series - a series produces whenever there is a sound produced by a string or by air (including nature. When a tone is produced (e.g. we hit a string in a guitar), the resulting sound is not just the tone intended, but it is a series of tones that create a harmony.

# Glossary

To avoid confusion (mainly my own), I'm adding a glossary of musical terms used in the project:

### Tone

A steady periodic sound. A musical tone is characterized by its duration, pitch, intensity, and timbre

### Note

A symbol denoting a musical sound (tone)

### Frequency

In music, the frequency dictates the pitch - frequency being directly proportional to the pitch of the tone we head (high frequency, high tone)

# Stack

Created using create-react-app + typescript as a starter. Besides that, I'm using the Web Audio API and Tone.js (library for Web Audio API). Eventually I want to use exclusively Tone.js (see the Projects tab)

Trying to keep it as light as possible
